Last update: 12:40am 12/08/2005 (AEST)<br /><p>
<ol>

<li>No Recruiting (Pasting your link)</li>
<br />
<li>No asking people to be your officer/commander</li><br />
<li>Make sure you don't LEAVE CAPS LOCK ON</li><br />
<li>No asking for voice/ops/any other power status, unless you rightfully own it</li><br />
<li>No flooding (Ask an operator for assistance in finding out what <i>flooding</i> is).</li><br />
<li>No annoying the admins</li><br />
<li>No advertising (websites, forums, other channels, or any other sort)</li></ol><br /><br />
<b>* If an operator asks you to do something, within the confinements of the chatroom, you do it or you leave</b><br />
I didn't think I would have to make that into a rule - I thought that would be common sense... Clearly some members of chat 
are not within grasp of that sense.
<br />
The operators are <b>volunteers</b> - they have real lives and real problems, and do a damn good job keeping the chat room (as) sane (as possible).
<br />
Please...give them some respect.
<br />

<br />


The above rules may be added/deleted/changed at any time without notice. Operators (%, @, &, and ~) may be excempt from 
any rules.<br />
<font color = "red">Please note, the operators have the <b>right</b> to kick or ban you at any point at their discression. If you have a problem
with an operator...</font><br />
